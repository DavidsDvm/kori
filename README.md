### **Kori**

*The on-chain engine that turns every MetaMask **debit** card into a true revolving **credit** card—while merchants get paid in seconds.*

---

#### 1 ▸ Why Kori needs to exist

Imagine Sara, a Bogotá freelancer who is paid in USDC and already spends it with the new MetaMask debit card. She can buy coffee anywhere Mastercard is accepted—**but she still can’t buy tomorrow’s laptop on credit**, and the online shop that sells it will wait up to **14–21 days** before PayPal or Amazon finally release the cash.

At the same time, “Buy-Now-Pay-Later” limits keep shrinking—the average BNPL loan has slid from **\$760 in 2020 to \$372 in 2025**.

**Consumers need credit; merchants need instant liquidity.** Kori delivers both.

#### 2 ▸ How Kori works — step-by-step

| Flow                        | What Sara experiences                                                                           | What happens behind the scenes                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connect Wallet**          | Clicks *“Sign in with MetaMask”*                                                                | MetaMask SDK / Delegation Toolkit proves wallet ownership (hackathon bonus #1).                                            |
| **Data Scan**               | Authorises read-only scan                                                                       | Kori’s oracle ingests on-chain cash-flow, wallet age, stablecoin balances **plus every swipe** of the MetaMask debit card. |
| **Score**                   | Sees her **KoriScore: 185**                                                                     | Smart-contract model grades 200+ variables and maps them into a 0-to-1,000 range. New users start small by design.         |
| **Unlock Store Credit**     | Bronze tier: \$100 line usable only at Kori partner stores                                      | A liquidity pool pre-funds the merchant in **instant USDC**; Sara owes Kori, not the merchant.                             |
| **Repay & Rise**            | Pays weekly via any chain                                                                       | Every on-time repayment mints an immutable “repayment attestation” NFT; her KoriScore climbs.                              |
| **Graduate to Card Credit** | Reaches Platinum at 610 points—now sees an extra **\$500 open-loop limit** on her MetaMask card | The riskiest channel (general-purpose card) is **capped at \~⅓** of her closed-loop line to keep exposure controlled.      |

#### 3 ▸ The tier ladder

| Tier         | Score     | Partner-store line\*                         | Card line\*\*     | Why it’s safe                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bronze**   | 0–200     | \$50 – \$100                                 | —                 | Below today’s typical BNPL ticket (≈\$372) to minimise losses.      |
| **Silver**   | 201–400   | Up to \$300                                  | —                 | Still under the \$200–\$1,000 band most first cards begin at. |
| **Gold**     | 401–600   | \$600 – \$1,000                              | —                 | Tops the “starter-card” spectrum yet stays merchant-locked.                        |
| **Platinum** | 601–800   | \$1,500 – \$2,000                            | \$300 – \$500     | Mirrors a secured card opened with a \$49–\$200 deposit.    |
| **Diamond**  | 801–1,000 | \$3,000 – \$5,000 (or 1× net monthly income) | \$1,000 – \$2,000 | Keeps open-loop credit <40 % of total, limiting worst-case loss.                   |

#### 4 ▸ Why merchants plug in—instantly

| Pain with legacy rails                                                                              | Kori upgrade                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Payouts **held 7–14 days** or more for new sellers | **USDC lands the moment the sale clears**—no reserves, no rolling holds. |
| 3–4 % card fees + chargebacks                                                                       | 1 % Kori settlement fee, **zero fraud chargebacks** (Kori owns risk).    |
| Small BNPL tickets (<\$400)                                                                         | Basket sizes climb as users tap expanding Kori lines.                    |

#### 5 ▸ Why users stay

* **From debit to credit without leaving self-custody.**
* **Exportable reputation.** Their repayment NFTs form a portable, privacy-preserving credit passport across Web3.
* **Rewards that compound.** 1 % USDC cash-back auto-stakes into a yield vault, growing future spending power.

#### 6 ▸ Business engine

1. **Instant-payout fee** — 1 % of every merchant settlement.
2. **Interchange share** — \~0.6 % on card-rail spend.
3. **Credit spread** — Borrow at 5 % stablecoin, lend at 12 % APR.
4. **Float yield** — Idle USDC swept into T-bill–backed on-chain funds.

Tiered exposure keeps expected loss below the BNPL late-payment rate of **41 %** reported in 2025 surveys.
